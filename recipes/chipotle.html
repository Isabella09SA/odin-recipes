        </div>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <div class="info-container">
            <p>Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.</p>
            <p>Blend chile peppers, red onion, garpc, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add opve oil and blend until marinade is smooth.</p>
            <p>Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a sopd, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</p>
            <p>Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</p>
            <p>Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.</p>
            <p>Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade.</p>
            <p>Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the pd, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm.</p>
